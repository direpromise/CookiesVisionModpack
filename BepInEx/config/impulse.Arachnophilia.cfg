# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 25
Max Web Count = 18

## The minimum length a web can be in units, !! I highly recommend to keep this value relatively low, if the value is too high then spider will struggle to find places to make webs as the walls may be too close!!
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 2
Min Web Length = 2

## The maximum length a web can be in units, !! Keep in mind that the smaller the differnce between the min and max length, the less spots a spider could successfully place a web!!
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 10
Max Web Length = 10

## This controls the distance in units a spider must be from the closest web in order to place a new one, a lower value will make webs closely knit, a higher value will make webs spaced further apart.

Min Distance Between Webs = 0.5

## How long in seconds the spider should wait after placing a web to place another
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 2
Web Placement Interval = 2

## This increases the interval and gives it some variation, the Web Placement Interval plus this value will be the max interval, the min interval will be the Web Placement Interval plus half of this value. (2 & 0.5 for these settings will result in a 2.25-2.5 second interval, 10 & 7 will result in a 13.5-17 second interval. etc)
